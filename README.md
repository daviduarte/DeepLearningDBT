~ Deep Learning DBT ~

This project aims to simulate the entire process of DBT reconstruction in a Artificial Neural Network (RNA). The
backprojection operator is simulated analitically as a fully-connected layer, (thus this have not any trainable parameter), and the Ram-Lak filter is implemented as a Convolutional Layer. This allow the inclusion of many others pre- or pos-processing
layer in the same RNA, making possible the RNA training end-to-end.
